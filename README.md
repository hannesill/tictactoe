# Tic Tac Toe â€“ Web Dev Practice

This is a simple tic tac toe game that I made to practice my web development skills. It is a single page application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The frameworks I used were Vue.js and tailwindcss.

The game is hosted on GitHub Pages at hannesill.github.io/tictactoe/
